# Context :

This is a front-end test project with :
- login authentication and logout "/login"
- listing of user conversations and their messages to their interlocutor "/conversations"
- reply to a message

### To run the projet :
- First, start the API server on port 3005 by running 'npm run start-server'.
- Second, run 'npm run dev'
- Then, go to login page '/login'

### I've covered this topic in this order :

  API call functions  =>  listing data & implementing components  =>  setup authentication  =>  logic & code review

# Library used for this project

  ### Authentication
  NextAuth.js (open-source, big community, easy to use, flexible, session persistence)

  ### Form
  React-Hook-Form (easy to implement & use, built-in functions, flexible and good performance)
